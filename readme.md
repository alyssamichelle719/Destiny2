# Destiny 2 Fan-made Website

I gave my Sophomore high school students a project to make a website based off either a fake game company or a game itself, because I wanted to make this website idea I have had in my head for a while. I told them I would do the project with them and this is the result of that(so far).

### Made With:
- Visual Studio Code
- Bootstrap 5
- HTML5
- An ass load of CSS
- Custom SVG on the homepage 
    - SVG traced and made with Illustrator.
- Some source code I look at on Bungie's website to see how they did stuff.
